Once you have the boxes being added correctly, 
you will need to do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the user can not enter a value for the 
    x or y coordinates that is valid.  Valid means the
    box must fit completely insode the box container.</li>
<li>Add a SELECT box (drop down list) with at least 4
    colors.  When the user clicks "Add Box", use the selected
    color as the background color.
</li>
<li> Change the select element to be a "color" input.  This will
allow the user to choose any color they want.</li>
<li>When the user clicks on each "box" it will remove it from the DOM</li>
<li>When the user hovers over the box, move it to a random location
in the container.</li>
<li>If the user enters no values, then add a box with a random color and x/y coordinates</li>
<li>Add a random z-index value between 1 and 20 to each box.</li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Extra Credit
</h4>
<p>Have each box randomly move and change background colors
    every 5 seconds.
